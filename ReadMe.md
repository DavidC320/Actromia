## About

You hear of a legendary object hidden within the confines of a dungeon.
Such an item that it was locked within the walls of stone, to never be
touched by another mortal again.
By itself it's worth a fortune, but once assembled with the other pieces
of the forgotten king's opulent armour,
it is said to bring immense power.
